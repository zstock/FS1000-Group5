          <h2>Review</h2>
          <p class="restaurant-paragraph"><strong>Food is great </strong>(3 months ago)<br />Service was some of the best I have seen. I thought the robots would be more involved in serving the food, they just came a few times and the servers did most of the work. All in all, great experience and awesome variety of food.</p>

          <p class="restaurant-paragraph"><strong>Robo Sushi is the best! </strong>(4 months ago)<br />They are definitely our best choice in North York or Scarborough area. Excellent variety of fresh and well prepared food, always carefully served in a beautiful way, clean and with no unnecessary waiting.</p>

          <h2>About Robo Sushi</h2>
          <p class="restaurant-paragraph-2">Robo Sushi may look like an undiscerning plaza spot from the outside, but don't be fooled: this restaurant is the most futuristic food endeavour to hit the Toronto food scene since the introduction of conveyer belt sushi.<br /><br /> Fusing the already wondrous experience of AYCE sushi with the perplexing world of robot tech, Robo Sushi is the first restaurant in the country where hostesses and servers are robots on wheels.<br /><br />While definitely not without its glitches, it feels like a beta version of what our future will one day be like and it's highly entertaining to say the least. The restaurant isn't a fully programmed establishment (yet), it's more of a mixed-service endeavour where robots are the main attraction but humans definitely still run the show.</p>
