          <p class="restaurant-paragraph"><strong>Great cocktails and finger food</strong> (1 month ago)<br />This place is amazing. The cocktails list is superb, and the winter warm cocktails are a real treat. But the food, wow! Tapas style food but very high quality. We spent a lazy afternoon slowly working our way through the small plate options. The seafood is superb. A place not to be missed when visiting Toronto.</p>

          <p class="restaurant-paragraph"><strong>Chill place</strong> (3 months ago)<br />Great place if you are looking for a quick bite. Clean, simple and uncomplicated. Service was quick and our server made excellent recommendations. We loved every bite. Lively young professionals in an upbeat and trendy setting. Loved the playlist! There was a wait list if you want to be seated inside or on the heated section of the patio. We opted not to wait so we were seated outside where it was a bit chilly but it was nice nonetheless.</p>

          <h2 class="columnheading">About Bar Raval</h2>
          <p class="restaurant-paragraph-2">Bar Raval is similar to its sibling restaurant Bar Isabel with a perpetually changing menu of Spanish tapas, but with a casual atmosphere that involves mostly standing room and a bar laden with pintxos.<br /><br />It’s another project of Grant van Gameren, who also has Eastern European pub Tennessee Tavern and mezcal-heavy bars El Rey and Pretty Ugly. Unlike these other places, though, Raval is open early til late for coffee and pastries up to cocktails and conservas.<br /><br />The smallish space is enrobed in swooping wooden curves that recall Gaudi or Dali, bottles lined up along the edges. Mirrors hide in corners behind narrow ledges, making the bar feel like it’s made up of a collection of intimate hidden nooks and crannies.<br /><br />Ms. Primo ($15) is just one of the eccentrically named, exhaustively described cocktails in what isn’t so much a menu but a gallery complete with little pictures of glassware. It’s a seductive and refreshing blend of Tio Pepe, chartreuse, cava, Ketel One, cucumber, lime, melon and mint.</p>
