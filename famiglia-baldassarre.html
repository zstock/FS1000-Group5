          <p class="restaurant-paragraph"><strong>Incredibly fresh pasta</strong> (3 weeks ago)<br />Absolutely incredible fresh pasta and freshly made food. Delicious and generous portions of truffle on Friday’s! The best I’ve had in the city! I can’t wait to go back. Highly recommend. Worth the wait! Great staff. Tip: bring cash, it’s cash only.</p>

          <p class="restaurant-paragraph"><strong>Great for date night</strong> (1 month ago)<br />I’ve been here several times and have never had anything less than a 5-star meal.  Leo and his team make unbelievable pasta that is well worth the wait.  Get there early (but not before me please) and enjoy — it’s truly, unequivocally worth the wait for one of the best meals you’ll enjoy in the city.  Just don’t expect to be productive after.</p>

          <h2 class="columnheading">About Famiglia Baldassarre</h2>
          <p class="restaurant-paragraph-2">Famiglia Baldassarre hand-makes 27 traditional types of wholesale fresh pasta from scratch for some of Toronto’s best restaurants, and also turns into a restaurant for a two-hour lunch service four days a week.<br /><br />This short window where pasta can be purchased for dine-in or takeout, the fact that only a few rotating fillings and shapes are available each day, and the high quality and technique involved in making the food are all part of why this place draws lineups before doors open.<br /><br />There are typically just two pasta shapes with two sauce options on the dine-in menu from noon to 2 p.m., Tuesday to Friday, but nearly 20 are retailed on the same days from noon until 5 p.m.</p>
