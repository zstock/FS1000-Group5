          <p class="restaurant-paragraph"><strong>Treat Youself $$</strong> (3 weeks ago)<br />If you want to treat yourself, this is the place to do it.  I thought this was going to be a typical tourist trap, but I was actually really pleased with my experience here.<br /><br />My boyfriend took me here for my birthday one year.  The view...I think is pretty self-explanatory.  It's beautiful.  And of course, the fact that it spins around (slowly) is every better.  I went for lunch, but I would love to come again for dinner as the sun is setting.<br /><br />We both got the fixed price menu and had an appetizer, main and dessert.  I was surprised at how big the portions were.  I find sometimes more expensive places - especially when you get the fixed menu - tend to have smaller portions.  These were definitely not small portions.  By the time I got to the dessert - which was absolutely delicious - I was so stuffed I couldn't finish it.  A lot of flavour in the dishes, and cooked excellently.<br /><br />The service was fantastic. Friendly, attentive and let's you enjoy the experience.  Everything you would want.</p>
