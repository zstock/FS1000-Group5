          <p class="restaurant-paragraph"><strong>Seafood like no other</strong> (2 weeks ago)<br />restaurants. Beautifully decorated, great atmosphere, and an endless selection of seafood, what more could a girl ask for? On the pricier side $$$ but you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />I went here for dinner with my family. We ordered one of the King Crab set menus, it came with a bottle of wine. When you place an order, they actually bring out the live crab for you to see, which is fun. The food was absolutely delicious, no complaints there. They actually add fries to the seafood tower - which was very tasty and a brilliant idea! <br /><br />highly recommend and will be back.</p>

          <h2 class="columnheading">About Fisherman Lobster Clubhouse</h2>
          <p class="restaurant-paragraph-2">Fishman Lobster Clubhouse emerged in the late aughts to become a certified 905 rite of passage. Since then, its cult status across food blogs for its photogenic seafood creations has widened in reach, making weekend reservations a must.<br /><nr />After a quick Pacific Mall re-up on the latest phone accessories, Asian snacks, bubble tea, and designer knock-offs, who doesn't want to end the day with supper paraded out through the aisles on a hook for inspection?</p>
