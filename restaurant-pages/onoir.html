          <h2>Review</h2>
          <p class="restaurant-paragraph"><strong>Eating in the dark could not be better!</strong> (1 week ago)<br />A wonderful experience, you are truly eating in complete darkness!  The wait staff were great and helpful with various allergies like shellfish and gluten, they were easily able to make substitutions. I'd recommend getting the surprise meal, it is fun to guess afterwards what you thought you ate.</p>

          <h2>About ONOIR</h2>
          <p class="restaurant-paragraph-2">Blind staff serves French-Italian fare in total darkness & surprise dishes test patrons' taste buds.<br /><br />Dining in the dark is a concept that has been around for a number of years; Dans le Noir in Paris and other cities, Opaque in California and the restaurant that started the trend, Blind Cow in Zurich. The owner, Moe Alameddine opened the first O.NOIR in Montreal three years ago and brought the dining in the dark experience to Toronto last June.<br /><br /> The main courses range from filet mignon to chicken with aubergine, pasta with tomato sauce and Veal al Limone. The only seafood on the menu is a marinated shrimp as apparently fish glows in the dark. Fruit sorbet, chocolate cake and a dark chocolate mousse with raspberry round out the dessert menu. For any of the courses diners are able to select the option to have a "surprise" course, meaning they bring you their choice from the menu.</p>
