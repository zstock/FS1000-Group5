          <p class="restaurant-paragraph"><strong>Good food, though not accessible</strong> (5 months ago)<br />This restaurant is arguably the best food I've ever had! The amount of food you get for the price is worth it! Not 5 stars because they recently renovated from being accessible to now not accessible at all! My able bodied friends had to order it take out for us instead of experiencing it inside. ☹️</p>

          <p class="restaurant-paragraph"><strong>Best kebabs in Toronto</strong> (7 months ago)<br />I celebrated my graduation yesterday in this delicious restaurant. I am glad to say that we enjoyed a fabulous evening and the restaurant was no doubt the reason for this outstanding event. The crew  contributed in a sweet style, the cuisine was appetizing and my friends were extremely  delighted. We shall absolutely visit again for more joyful events. thanks very much.</p>

          <h2>About Mustafa</h2>
          <p class="restaurant-paragraph-2">Mustafa is THE place to get Turkish pizza in North York, perhaps Toronto. Turkish pizza, or pide (pronounced pee-deh) as it's more traditionally known, is a long, flat, boat-like bread stuffed with cheese and other toppings.<br /><br />Located on Wilson Avenue in one of North York's many fine strip malls, the interior of this restaurant is designed to look like a cave in Turkey. Look way up for the sign, because it's on top of the roof, so you might miss it otherwise. The decor, complete with fake vines, is a little like that of Nazareth . Gigantic, sturdy wooden benches are either made from whole tree trunks or just look like they are.<br /><br />Mustafa is well-known and popular, with many customers excitedly rushing in and out picking up take-out orders. If you haven't tried the sensation known as Turkish pizza yet, Mustafa in North York might just be the best place to do it.</p>
